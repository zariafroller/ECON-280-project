title: README for extension of “Childcare, Labor Supply, and Business Development: Experimental Evidence from Uganda” (Bjorvatn et al. 2025)
---

## Overview

The code in this repository extends the maternal labor supply results from Bjorvatn et al. (2025) using Stata. Two main files run the code to conduct the analysis and create output tables. 

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

The data come from the replication package of Bjorvatn et al. 2025, available on the AEA website (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20230227). 

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).
- [ ] Confidential data used in this paper and not provided as part of the public replication package will be preserved for ___ years after publication, in accordance with journal policies. 

### Summary of Availability

- [X] All data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Some data **cannot be made** publicly available.
- [ ] **No data can be made** publicly available.

- [ ] Confidential data used in this paper and not provided as part of the public replication package will be preserved for ___ years after publication, in accordance with journal policies. 

### Software Requirements

- [ ] The replication package contains one or more programs to install all dependencies and set up the necessary directory structure.

- Stata (code was last run with version 19)
  - `parmest` (as of 2025-12-01)

### Controlled Randomness

- [ ] Random seed is set at line _____ of program ______
- [ ] The analysis relies on random number generation, but setting a seed is not possible (explanation follows)
- [X] No Pseudo random generator is used in the analysis described here.

#### Summary time to reproduce

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (CURRENT YEAR) desktop machine:

- [X] <10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-2 hours
- [ ] 2-8 hours
- [ ] 8-24 hours
- [ ] 1-3 days
- [ ] 3-14 days
- [ ] > 14 days

#### Summary of required storage space

Approximate storage space needed:

- [ ] < 25 MBytes
- [X] 25 MB - 250 MB
- [ ] 250 MB - 2 GB
- [ ] 2 GB - 25 GB
- [ ] 25 GB - 250 GB
- [ ] > 250 GB

- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described below.

#### Computational Details

The code was last run on a **2018 Macbook Air with a 1.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 processor**. 


## Description of programs/code

- Files in `code` folder run the regressions and produce tables. 

## Instructions to Replicators

- Edit `code/wrapper.do` to adjust the default path
- Download the data files referenced above. Each should be stored in the prepared subdirectories of `data/`, in the format that you download them in. 
- Run `code/wrapper.do` to run all steps in sequence.
